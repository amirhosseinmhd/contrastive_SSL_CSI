# Wi-Fi Sensing with Self-Supervised Learning

This project implements a self-supervised learning framework for deriving representations from Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) data. Using the DirectCLR approach within contrastive self-supervised learning methodologies, the system encodes CSI data into robust embeddings without relying on labeled data. The implementation includes various data augmentation techniques and a tailored backbone architecture specifically designed for CSI data processing.
